My #1GAM April submission, written in Java (LibGDX). The idea for this project came up when I heard about the 'water' theme. It's a different game with very offense mechanics.

## Story

Your country doesn't obey very well. They demonstrate on all streets, fighting against the police and fight for their right. Now it is your turn to keep control! Keep them at bay with your forces and water guns. Keep them small, keep them little.

But be careful: you may threaten others (media). Don't loose control or you loose!

## Platforms

This game is developed for **HTML5** browsers, *smartphones* and **PCs** by using [LibGDX](http://libgdx.badlogicgames.com/).
